Cordova Play Services Versions Incompatibility Adapter plugin
================================================

Adapt versions of Google Play Services that use the plugins of your application automatically so that the developer does not have to worry anymore.
Simply install this plugin in your application, and when we compile we take care of optimizing your versions of Google Play Services without you having to stop to think about it for a second

---
## Quick start ##

To install this plugin, follow the [Command-line Interface Guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-line%20Interface). You can use one of the following command lines:

* `cordova plugin add cordova-admob`
* `cordova plugin add https://github.com/appfeel/admob-google-cordova.git`

---
## Harmonization ##

As soon as the application compiles, all the versions of your Google Play Services plugins are automatically adapted informing you at all times of the changes made.

All plugins that use Google Play Services in an application must use the same version, in case there is no version of Google Play Services compatible with all your plugins together we inform you in detail about the error
